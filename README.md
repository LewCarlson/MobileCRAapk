# MobileCRAapk
Here you will find MobileCRA install packages for Android devices.
It may be possible to install a new level without doing an uninstall.
But if you have problems uninstall the existing version of MobileCRA before the new install.
Remember all CourseFiles will be lost if you uninstall.
So save what you want before an uninstall. (DemoStart & DemoRated will reload after an uninstall.)

1. Tap View Code.

2. Tap the level you want, generaly the latest, highest number.

3. Tap the 3 dots in the box that has the number of MB.

4. Download should appear, click and follow the prompts.
